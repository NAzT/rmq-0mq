# Backlog

 * Supervision hierarchy -- zmq:start_link needs to be done before
   anything else, but it's a worker like everything else. Maybe do by
   having the app start each service, rather than the sup. (on the
   other hand, we probably want one-for-all wrt the zmq process)
 * Echo the config to logs/console
 * Deal with more than one path element (encode with length)
 * Sort out how to use acks and passive mode to put the back-pressure
   on sockets, rather than filling up process mailboxes
 * Consider separating into req, rep, pub, sub, upstream, downstream
   services.

# Features

 * Starting (and maybe stopping) services dynamically.
 * Validate configurations, perhaps check for socket clashes.
 * Mgmt interface?
 * Ability to enumerate services
 * Use event mechanism for stats

# Done

 * Pipeline and request/reply
 * Refactor service gen_servers
 * Revisit reqrep design -- ought to be able to do it without
   alternate exchange (and that's going to cause problems anyway,
   since it can't be applied to an existing exchange, e.g., the
   default exchange).
