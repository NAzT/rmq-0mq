# Backlog

 * Supervision hierarchy -- zmq:start_link needs to be done before
   anything else, but it's a worker like everything else. Maybe do by
   having the app start each service, rather than the sup.
 * Refactor service gen_servers
 * Echo the config to logs/console
 * Pipeline and request/reply
 * Revisit reqrep design -- ought to be able to do it without
   alternate exchnage (and that's going to cause problems anyway,
   since it can't be applied to an existing exchange, e.g., the
   default exchange).

# Features

 * Starting (and maybe stopping) services dynamically.
 * Validate configurations, perhaps check for socket clashes.
 * Mgmt interface?
 * Use event mechanism
